The basic process is as follows
1. Prepare DeviceID list by RestAPI / Intelligence Reports
    - Use DevID as header (might be Case Sensitive) 
2. Capture the request traffic with Postman Interceptor Extension
    - Install Extension on preferred browser
    - Start Postman
    - Login to UEM and go to device detail
    - Start Capture on the extension (sample capture request below should be populated with the required cookies for auth) 
      https://cn1689.awmdm.com/AirWatch/Devices/RequestHubRepair/xxxxxx?workpasscode=false&actionType=
    - Send Repair hub command 
    - Stop capture on the extension and open link to Postman app (desktop)
3. Postman Preparations
    - Save the request to a new / existing collection
    - Set variables in the collection with DevID as variable name and a random device id as value
    - edit the request to use DevID as variable, eg: https://cn1689.awmdm.com/AirWatch/Devices/RequestHubRepair/{{DevID}}?workpasscode=false&actionType=
    - go to the collection and click Run
    - On the test data file clik select file and choose the csv files with device id listed  (usually choose Use Locally) 
    - Run the collection
